This was my portfolio site throughout 2019 and early 2020. It's built upon the [sanity-gatsby blog starter project](https://github.com/sanity-io/sanity-template-gatsby-blog/tree/fd3b7816583d77772a517aef04ea53971dec9ff9) from Sanity.io, and, because of that, it's not very pretty under the hood. 😬

The project was a great learning opportunity for me to get more familiar with React, Gatsby and using a CMS, but it didn't give me (or I didn't take) much room to explore design or architecture. I'm expanding on both now in my new site, and you can check out more on that process in the [repo](https://github.com/alexanderlim9/portfolio-2020.6).
